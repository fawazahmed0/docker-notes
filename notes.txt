Spitting out file from docker:


Dockerfile content:
--------------------------
FROM debian:unstable
WORKDIR /papa
COPY script.sh script.sh
RUN chmod 777 script.sh
CMD bash -C 'script.sh'


Workdir creates a directory in container and uses that as base,
copy will copy the script.sh from host to workdir/script.sh (/papa/script.sh)

the docker will stop as soon as scripts stops

script.sh content:
-------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
echo 'hello' > '/tata/test.txt'


we will bind mount the host direcotry to container direcoty using docker desktop in Run -> optional settings
in our case to /tata/  direcotry in container , as the script.sh will save the file there, bind mount will auto create the dir if donesn't exists



To copy file from container live use docker cp command:

To build docker image:
