Spitting out file from docker:


Dockerfile content:
--------------------------
FROM debian:unstable
WORKDIR /papa
COPY script.sh script.sh
RUN chmod 777 script.sh
CMD bash -C 'script.sh'


Workdir creates a directory in container and uses that as base,
copy will copy the script.sh from host to workdir/script.sh (/papa/script.sh)

the docker will stop as soon as scripts stops

script.sh content:
-------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
echo 'hello' > '/tata/test.txt'


we will bind mount the host direcotry to container direcoty using docker desktop in Run -> optional settings
in our case to /tata/  direcotry in container , as the script.sh will save the file there, bind mount will auto create the dir if donesn't exists



To copy file from container live use docker cp command:

& vice versa:

To build docker image:
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/
eg:
 docker build -t getting-started .
 where -t is tag name and . is the dir containing Dockerfile

 I tried building all binaries compilatino project with docker, but problem is with mips,
 i have to use openwrt toolchain (gcc etc) to build, the official debain mips gcc desn't work
I tried comipling simple helo world progmra https://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/an_introduction_to_gcc/gccintro_9.html 
with debain and  openwrt toolchain, the other one worked in mips router


---------------
Running docker application (for example a specific version of node)

docker pull node:15.14.0-alpine3.13
Run the application in docker desktop and mount the package folder from settings and get the name of docker container
docker exec -ti zen_feynman node script.js
(zen_feynman is container name)
